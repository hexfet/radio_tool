Quick hack for protocol and receiver testing.  This is a PSoC Creator 4.1 project for the CY8CKIT-049-42xx board.  Code is ported from Deviation project at deviationtx.com.  All code is covered under the GNU Public License version 3.


The protocol_chk project controls deviation supported radio chips and runs deviation protocol files (slightly modified).


The receiver_chk protocol decodes PPM, PWM, and SBUS.  Results are sent to the USB serial port.
